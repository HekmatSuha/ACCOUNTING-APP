# Fix SKU Unique Constraint Issue

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Analyzed the IntegrityError issue with duplicate SKUs
- [x] Identified that Product model has unique=True constraint on SKU field
- [x] Added SKU validation in ProductSerializer to check for duplicates
- [x] Added user-specific SKU validation (SKUs are unique per user)
- [x] Added handling for both create and update operations
- [x] Added support for blank/empty SKUs

## Summary of Changes
The fix adds proper validation in the ProductSerializer to prevent duplicate SKU errors by:
1. Checking if a SKU already exists for the current user before creating/updating
2. Providing a clear, user-friendly error message when duplicate SKU is detected
3. Allowing blank/empty SKUs (as per model definition)
4. Handling both create and update operations correctly

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test creating product with duplicate SKU - should return 400 with clear error
- [ ] Test creating product with unique SKU - should succeed
- [ ] Test creating product with blank SKU - should succeed
- [ ] Test updating product with existing SKU - should succeed if it's the same product
- [ ] Test updating product with different existing SKU - should fail with clear error
